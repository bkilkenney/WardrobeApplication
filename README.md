# WardrobeApplication

This database first ASP.NET MVC Web Application is for organizing your wardrobe.  Because all of the clothing types(tops, bottoms,
shoes, accessories) have the same properties I chose to keep them in the same table, and linked the tables via ClosetID as the 
foreign key.  A relative path was used to display an image for each article of clothing in the user's closet.  The images are saved
in the content folder.  

Features Include:

-Styled Navbar
-Footer relative to the contents of the page view
-Search field in Navbar
-Glyphicon for the road to getting organized
-Glyphicon for payment types accepted
-Google Fonts 
-Font-Shadow 
-Thumbnails
-Row and columns in the Closets/Index.cshtml view
-Active links in the Home/Index.cshtml view which open new tabs targeted at relavant websites
-Icons from Awesome Fonts

An outfit model was created and linked to the Closet table with ClosetID as the foreign key.  The additional stetch task of using
clothing from each type to create an outfit could not be completed.
